 *
 * 	The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
 * 	12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385
 * 	The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
 * 	(1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025
 * 	Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the
 * 	sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.
 *
 * @problem Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
 * @solution 25164150
